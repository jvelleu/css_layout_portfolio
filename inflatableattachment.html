		<p>About: The Smart Materials &amp; Structures Design Lab at the University of Michigan works in collaboration with Gneral Motors to develop advanced automotive technologies.</p>
		
		<p>Brief: Design an Inflatable Attachment hat is lightweight, stowable, and an adaptive constraint for a wide variety of objects that commonly exist with vehicle spaces.</p>
	
		<p>My Role: Lead Researcher for Inflatable Attachments</p>
	
		<p>Research: Attachemtnts of all sorts are used in vehicles. Anything from cup holders, to GPS mounts, to seatback pockets are used to hold the many objects</p>
	
		<p>Concept Generation: A wide variety of ideas were proposed and discussed with engineers at GM R&amp;D. At this stage, little regard to the feasability of creating these concpets was taken. Concepts were then  systematically downselects to a chosen direction. The selected cpncept was based off of inflatable achitectured popular in soft robtics. However, a unique actuation was developed by modifing this architecture and utilizing the interplay of this actuation with a rigid hosuing to creat a novel locking mechanism for the bending actuator.</p>
	
		<p>Prototyping: Prototypes were molded from silicon elastomers and the housing was 3D-printed.</p>
	
		<p>Result: The design has been co-patented by the design team and General Motors</p>
