	About: The Shapiro Undergraduate Library issued a design challenge to redeign an under-utilized space on the 3rd floor of the library using Herman-Miller furniture.
	
	Brief: Redaign an 20'x25' space to foster collaboration, act as centralized meeting hub, and generally increase usage of the space.
	
	My Role: Layout Designer, Survey Designer
	
	Research: The team developed a short digital survey given out to students in the library in order to uderstand the study habits and desires of the stakeholders. Small group seating, visualization tools, and the abiity to hold quiet discussion were identified as the primary desires for collaborative study spaces.
	
	Concept: The floorplan was sketched and different furniture arrangments were created. The finalized design utilized winding dividors to create semi-private alcoves around tables that would encourage low-noise discussion and provied walls for whitebores.
