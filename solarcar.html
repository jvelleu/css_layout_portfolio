	Collaborators: University of Michigan Solar Car team (2016-2017)
	
	About: The Solar Car team competes in national and internation competitions in which they design, build, and race 100% solar-powered cars over thousands of kilometers in multi-day races.
	
	Brief: Create a visual tool to guide students in pitches to potential team sponsors.
	
	My Role: Lead Brand Strategist, Sponsor Relations, Production Lead 
	
	U-M's Solar Car team is a multi-disiplanary orginization that requires not only engineering, but business and strategy as well. The entirely student-run org. operates on a multi-million dollar anual budget, which is entirely funded throught donations procured by student team-members. With over 70 members at any given time, the team required a standardized document that could not only be given out to potential sponsors and professional represent the org., but also unify the message and establish guidelines for sponsorship pitches.
	
	Previous documents had been attempted, but results were largely amaturish or ineffective. 
	
	Design: In collaboration with the team's Business Division, sponsorship "levels" were defined and key advantages of sponsoring the team were identified. Then, the layout for the document was designed to exist as a pdf and and printed as bound booklets. 
	
	Result: The Sponsorship Packet was instrumental in the team raising over 2 million dollars for the project cycle. In this time they placed 1st in the American Solar Challenge and 2nd in the World Solar Challenge.
